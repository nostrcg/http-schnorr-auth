Welcome to the repository for the **HTTP Authentication Using Schnorr Signatures** specification, developed by the [W3C Nostr Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/nostr/). This specification defines a decentralized and secure method for authenticating HTTP requests using Schnorr signatures.

## Introduction

As decentralized applications gain momentum, there's a growing need for secure, user-centric authentication mechanisms that don't rely on centralized authorities. This specification leverages Schnorr signaturesâ€”widely used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Litecoinâ€”to provide a seamless, secure, and privacy-preserving authentication protocol suitable for modern web applications.

## Background

Schnorr signatures are renowned for their simplicity, efficiency, and provable security. Their adoption in blockchain technologies underscores their robustness and suitability for decentralized systems. By integrating Schnorr signatures into HTTP authentication, we aim to bridge the gap between traditional web services and decentralized authentication methods.

## Use Cases

- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Authenticate across multiple services using a single cryptographic identity, eliminating passwords and enhancing user experience.
- **Decentralized Authentication:** Enable authentication in decentralized apps where traditional methods fall short, giving users control over their data.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Use existing cryptographic keys from blockchain networks to authenticate with web services securely.

## Getting Started

To implement or experiment with the specification:

1. **Read the Specification:** Familiarize yourself with the protocol details by reading the [latest draft](https://nostrcg.github.io/http-schnorr-auth/).

2. **Reference Implementations:**
   - **C# ASP.NET Authentication Handler:** [NostrAuth.cs](https://gist.github.com/v0l/74346ae530896115bfe2504c8cd018d3)
   - *(More implementations coming soon!)*

3. **Implement the Protocol:**
   - **Clients:** Construct and sign authentication events using your private Schnorr keys.
   - **Servers:** Validate incoming authentication events as per the specification guidelines.
